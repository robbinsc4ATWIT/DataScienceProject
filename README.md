# DataScienceProject
# Introduction
The National Basketball Association (NBA) stands as one of the most prestigious professional basketball leagues globally, showcasing top-tier athletes from around the world. As the NBA continues to evolve, teams face the ongoing challenge of effectively evaluating player performance, making informed decisions on player contracts, and predicting player career longevity. In this project, I aim to explore these key aspects of NBA player analysis using a comprehensive dataset encompassing player statistics, contract details, and career trajectories.
# Research Questions
1. Impact of player height on effectivness: This question will explore the physical attribute of height and how it relates to a players key performance metrics. I expect there to be a positive correlation when the NBA is analyzed as a whole.
2. Correlation Increase: I seek to investigate wether there is a correlation between a players increase in contract and their performance.
3. Contract Valuation: Analyzing the relationship between player performance and contract value to determine if certain performance metrics are undervalued or overvalued in player contracts.
# Data sets
The data sets from this project will take sources from the NBA and ESPN website to find advanced player statistics. ESPN also has all of the player salary data. These data sets will likely need to be combined in order to analyze in python.
# methodology
My analysis will involve data exploration, feature engineering, and statistical modeling techniques to address the research questions outlined above. I will utilize Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. The dataset used for this study comprises comprehensive NBA player statistics, contract details, and demographic information, providing a comprehensive analysis of player performance and career trajectories.

Through this project, I aim to contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding NBA player evaluation and decision-making processes, providing actionable insights for teams, coaches, and analysts in the basketball industry.
